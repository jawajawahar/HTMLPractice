  ctopussy is a 1983 spy film and the thirteenth in the James Bond series
  produced by Eon Productions. It is the sixth to star Roger Moore as the MI6
  agent James Bond. It was directed by John Glen and the screenplay was written
  by George MacDonald Fraser, Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson. The film's
  title is taken from a short story in Ian Fleming's 1966 short story collection
  Octopussy and The Living Daylights, although the film's plot is mostly
  original. It does, however, contain a scene adapted from the Fleming short
  story "The Property of a Lady" included in 1967 and later editions
